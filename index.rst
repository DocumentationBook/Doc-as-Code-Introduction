Most probably you have already heard a lot about the doc-as-code approach,
especially among program developers and technical writers. This is one more attempt to outline what it
actually means.


What doc-as-code means
======================

First of all, the documentation is treated similar to programs in the following aspects:

*  Documentation source files are stored in a version control system.
*  The code is reviewed by various reviewers (managers, developers, analysts, technical writers)
*  Documents are tested for accuracy and functionality. Especially it concerns code examples, links
   sequence of operations, and other practical parts.
*  Documentation artifacts are produced and published automatically.


Benefits
========

Doc-as-code is a partial implementation of the `literate programming <http://www.literateprogramming.com/>`_ paradigm,
which is based on close binding between documentation and program code.
This paradigm means that documentation goes first, and between the documentation
paragraphs goes the program code that implements the process described in the documentation.
The main benefit is to make a program much more clear, so that it is easier to maintain
with all technical and commercial advantages this entails.
